Hey there! I'm a computer science student who likes to code in TypeScript. I started out making front-end websites, but now I'm getting more into back-end stuff with Node.js and TypeScript too. Building full-stack apps lets me bring ideas to life with good code and slick designs. My goal isn't just to make cool things, but to build tools that actually help people out in meaningful ways. There's so many problems worth fixing if you know how to use the right digital tools. And I think TypeScript gives me the flexibility and speed I need to create solutions that matter. 

But of course I don't just learn one language, there are many repos that I wrote using languages other than typescript/javascript. Basically, the main principle I follow is Share. Care. Connect.
