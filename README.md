I'm a computer science student passionate about coding in TypeScript and building full-stack apps. I create front-end websites and back-end systems with Node.js to turn ideas into well-coded, user-friendly solutions. My goal is to build tools that meaningfully help people by solving real-world problems. I use various languages beyond TypeScript as well to follow my principle of sharing knowledge, caring about users, and connecting ideas to actions.
