I'm a computer savvy student who codes in TypeScript. I started out creating frontends, but now I'm diving deeper into backend tech with Node.js and TypeScript. Building fullstack apps allows me to bring ideas to life through clean code and sleek interfaces. My goal is to use my skills not just to develop cool stuff, but also make tools that meaningfully impact people's lives. There are so many problems out there worth solving if you have the right digital toolkit. And I believe TypeScript gives me both the creative freedom and performance to craft solutions that count.
