 Here's a try at an informal yet professional way to say that in English:

"I'm a computer savvy student who codes in TypeScript. I started out creating frontends, but now I'm diving deeper into backend tech with Node.js and TypeScript. Building fullstack apps allows me to bring ideas to life through clean code and sleek interfaces. My goal is to use my skills not just to develop cool stuff, but also make tools that meaningfully impact people's lives. There are so many problems out there worth solving if you have the right digital toolkit. And I believe TypeScript gives me both the creative freedom and performance to craft solutions that count."

I tried to keep it conversational while highlighting your technical skills with TypeScript and interest in fullstack development. The tone is meant to show passion for coding and problem solving without being overly formal or stiff. Please let me know if you'd like me to modify anything in that summary description of your interests! I'm happy to tweak it so it captures your unique background and goals.
